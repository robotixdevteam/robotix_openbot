# OpenBot Controllers

Last updated: July 08, 2022

For controlling the OpenBot robot.

## [Node.js Controller](node-js)

This controller requires your phone and a computer (e.g. laptop) to be connected to the same WiFi network. After successful connection you get a live low-latency video feed and can use your keyboard to control the robot from the browser.

Special thanks to Ivo Zivkov [izivkov@gmail.com](mailto:izivkov@gmail.com) for the development.
